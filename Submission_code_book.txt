This file describes additional analysis to the measurements obtained in the files "features_info.txt" and "features.txt".

Values for x_test.txt, y_test.txt, x_train.txt, y_train.txt,subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt (test and training sets) were merged into columns, in sequecne of test/train.
x_test and x_train correspond to the measurements and y_test, y_train to the particular activity (enumerated 1-6), and subject_test, subject_train enumerate the human performing the activity.


Column headers were added verbatim from the file "features.txt" for each of the 561 measurements, and the description of the activities (STANDING,WALKING, etc) corresponding to the numbers 1-6 were parsed into a column with order of subject and activity number preserved.

For example, R-script "combine_data.R" delineates the procedure of combining the data, into file "all_data.csv"
Functions in R including specialized expressions from the DPLYR package produce this data frame.

Our post-processing instruction was to select all time-window-average (mean) and standard deviation (STD) taken for relevant measurements. Note that 'meanfreq' measurements do not apply. These are NOT time-averages of the t-window measurements, they are weighted averages of the FFT power spectrum.

Corresponding column names are as follows - note however DPLYR replacement of characters ',' '(' ')' '-' with '.' to make them DPLYR-friendly titles.:

Data were sorted first by subject and then by activity type, and each sort- pair was then averaged, e.g. subject 1, WALKING, subject 1, STANDING, etc

See file "subject_activity_means.csv"  Note script checks if files are written to avoid duplication of effort. Deleting or renaming "alldata.csv" will start the process from the beginning
